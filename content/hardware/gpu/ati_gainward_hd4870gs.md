<div class="block">
  Back in 2009 I wanted to have an HD4870 but I felt like that would be OP for 1080p gaming so I choosed a HD4850 Golde Sample instead.
  A few days ago I got my hands on this HD4870 Golden Sample and I love it. Performance is great and the fan is very quiet.
  Note that there is switch for "normal" and "turbo" modes. I usually stick to "normal".
