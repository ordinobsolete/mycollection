  Back in 2009, ATI HD4850 were great value cards that even offered support for DirectX 10.1 even if that was not used at all.
  I was a great fan of that Gainward Golden Sample ❤️ cards because they were beautiful, overclocked, and absolutely inaudible.
  I used to play <em>The Witcher</em>, <em>Dragon Age: Origins</em> and <em>Mass Effect<em> on Windows 7 and had a great time.
