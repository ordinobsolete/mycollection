This cards has great Sound Blaster Pro emulation on Dos, unfortunatelly PCM audio is distorded in Jazz Jackrabbit and I could not figure out why. Note that I'm not sure about the name of this card (could be <a href="https://www.philscomputerlab.com/82c929a.html">MAD16</a> according to <a href="https://www.philscomputerlab.com/82c929a.html">PhilsComputerLab</a>). I am also not sure about the release year.
