<div class="block">Ensoniq used to build cheap PCI sound card that could compete with Creative. The later just decided to buy Ensoniq and renamme the card. There are at least 3 models that are pretty much identical: Ensoniq Audio PCI, Sound Blaster PCI 64, Sound Blaster PCI 128.</div>

<div>I don't recommend this card for DOS gaming because OPL Emulation is total garbage and MIDI wavetables have a crackle bug under Duke Nukem 3D. See my <a href="https://youtu.be/XpYLCgQNjKk">review</a> (in French &#127467;&#127479;).</div>
