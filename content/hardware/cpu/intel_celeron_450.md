I'm very confused. <a href="https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/35239/intel-celeron-processor-450-512k-cache-2-20-ghz-800-mhz-fsb.html">Intel</a> and <a href="https://www.x86-guide.net/electronlibre/fr/collection/cpu/Intel-Celeron-450-cpu-no10615.html">x86-guide</a> both says this CPU is from 2008, but there is that big "06" written on it, so I'd say 2006 instead.

Anyway it does look likes a low end CPU for cheap OEM PCs.
