<p>Remember back in the time when AMD Ryzen did not exist. Intel was a big fan of "artifical segmentation". Pentium = 2 cores, i3 = 2 cores @ 4 threads, i5 = 4 cores, i7 = 4 cores @ 8 threads. And then later came the "K" suffix that basically just allows overclocking.<br/><br/>
Well I guess that i3-3220 shouldn't be that bad for a Windows XP / Vista build.
