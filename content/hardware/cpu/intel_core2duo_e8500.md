  <p>
Back in 2008, gamers had to choose their side:
<ul>
  <li>- Invest in Core 2 Quad CPU because "I'm sure games will be hyperthreaded soon"</li>
  <li>- Stick with a powerfull single or dual core CPU because "all games run in 32 bits + single thread anyway".</li>
</ul>
The E8400 / E8500 and E8600 were powerfull yet efficient (thanks to 45 nm) processors. Many people choosed the E8400 and were able to easilly overclock to 4 GHz.
