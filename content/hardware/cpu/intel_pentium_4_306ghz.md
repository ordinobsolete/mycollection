  <p>
    The surface is mostly unreadable, fortunately I took some notes years ago.<br/>
    This CPU has Hyperthreading, which was new at the time.<br/>
    I found that <a href="https://www.hardware.fr/articles/445-11/conclusion.html">review</a> in French from 2002. I'm not sure that's exactly the same model but the price was "<strong>750-800 €</strong>" (1064-1134€) in 2023.
